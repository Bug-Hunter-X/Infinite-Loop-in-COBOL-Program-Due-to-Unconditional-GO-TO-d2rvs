This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programming: the use of an unconditional GO TO statement to create an infinite loop. The program also showcases two counter variables that will loop indefinitely but with slightly different ranges. This example highlights how unstructured programming can lead to difficult-to-debug issues. The solution provided demonstrates a structured approach, making the program much more readable, maintainable, and efficient.
